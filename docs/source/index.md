## Introduction

torchsynth is based upon traditional modular synthesis written in
pytorch. It is GPU-optional and differentiable.

Most synthesizers are fast in terms of latency. torchsynth is fast
in terms of throughput.

## Installation

```
pip3 install torchsynth
```

Note that torchsynth requires PyTorch version 1.8 or greater.
