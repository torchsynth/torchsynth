Developer guidelines
====================

## Initial developer setup

```
git clone https://github.com/turian/torchsynth
cd torchsynth
pip3 install -e ".[dev]"
```

Make sure you have pre-commit hooks installed:
```
pre-commit install
```
This helps us avoid checking dirty jupyter notebook cells into the
repo.

## `examples/`

Unfortunately, Python 3.9 (e.g. OSX Big Sur) won't work, because
librosa repends upon numba which isn't packaged for 3.9 yet. In
which case you'll have to create a Python 3.7 conda environment.
(You might also need to downgrade LLVM to 10 or 9.):
```
conda install -c conda-forge ipython librosa matplotlib numpy matplotlib scipy jupytext
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=envname
```
and change the kernel to `envname`.

## Tests

Unit testing is performed using `pytest`.

To run tests, run `pytest` from the project root:
```
pytest
```

To run tests with a coverage report:
```
pytest --cov=./torchsynth
```
