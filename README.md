{\tt torchsynth} is based upon traditional modular synthesis, but is GPU-enabled and is differentiable.

## Development Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/turian/torchsynth
cd torchsynth
pip install -e .
```

Note that torchsynth requires PyTorch version 1.7 or greater.

### Examples

We recommend that you run examples through Jupyter notebooks, and
that you have
[jupytext](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-jupytext-9234fdff6c57)
installed. It's a little fiddly to install, and those instructions
are the best. jupytext makes it easy to put demo notebooks into
the repo as Python files. (Larger assets like ipynb files we should
avoid.)

To run examples, you should also do:
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Unfortunately, Python 3.9 (e.g. OSX Big Sur) won't work, because
librosa repends upon numba which isn't packaged for 3.9 yet. In
which case you'll have to create a Python 3.7 conda environment.
(You might also need to downgrade LLVM to 10 or 9.):
```
conda install -c conda-forge ipython librosa matplotlib numpy matplotlib scipy jupytext
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=envname
```
and change the kernel to `envname`.

### Tests
Unit testing is performed using `pytest`.

`pytest` and other project development dependencies can be installed as follows: 
```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

To run tests, run `pytest` from the project root:
```
pytest
```

To run tests with a coverage report:
```
pytest --cov=./src
```
