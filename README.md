The fastest synth in the universe.

torchsynth is based upon traditional modular synthesis written in
pytorch. It is GPU-optional and differentiable.

Most synthesizers are fast in terms of latency. torchsynth is fast
in terms of throughput.

You will need to install the particular version of
[torchcsprng](https://github.com/pytorch/csprng) for your CUDA
device. Please follow their simple installation instructions.  But
if you use the CPU version of torchcsprng, it probably won't affect
performance much.

## Development Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/turian/torchsynth
cd torchsynth
pip3 install -e ".[dev]"
```

Make sure you have pre-commit hooks installed:
```
pre-commit install
```
This helps us avoid checking dirty jupyter notebook cells into the
repo.

Note that torchsynth requires PyTorch version 1.7 or greater.

### Examples

Unfortunately, Python 3.9 (e.g. OSX Big Sur) won't work, because
librosa repends upon numba which isn't packaged for 3.9 yet. In
which case you'll have to create a Python 3.7 conda environment.
(You might also need to downgrade LLVM to 10 or 9.):
```
conda install -c conda-forge ipython librosa matplotlib numpy matplotlib scipy jupytext
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=envname
```
and change the kernel to `envname`.

### Tests
Unit testing is performed using `pytest`.

`pytest` and other project development dependencies can be installed as follows: 
```
pip3 install -e ".[test]"
```

To run tests, run `pytest` from the project root:
```
pytest
```

To run tests with a coverage report:
```
pytest --cov=./torchsynth
```
